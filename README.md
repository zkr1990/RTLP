# RTLP project

This project deals with Routing Table LookuP using Perfect Hash oriented solutions.

Three folders are used to provide source code and experiment results. Each folder can be used as an independant project.

1. PHF_benchmark

Benchmark code for existing PHF algorithms: BDZ_PH, CHD_PH, BBHash, SPHF, SPHF-RTLP.

2. RHF

Routing Hash Function(RHF) source code: RHF1 and RHF2.

3. HLS

RTLP solutions emulation on Xilinx FPGA.
